## Bio 
>Joffery Baratheon was the son of King Robert Baratheon and  Queen Cersei Lannister. Joffery's biological father was Ser Jaime Lannister. Joffery grew up to be a spoiled sadistic child that thought nothing of others and only of himself. In 298 A.C., King Robert would die and Queen Cersei would crown Joffery as King. Joffery's first major act as King would be to order the death of Ned Stark. This action started the war between the Lannisters and the Starks and led to the capture of Joffery's true father, Jaime Lannister at the hands of the Starks. Joffery would not take the field personally as his faction was largely led by his Lannister family members. Chiefly, his grandfather the mighty [Tywin Lannister](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tywin_Lannister), Lord of the Westerlands. Joffery would reign with a marked sadistic streak ordering the death of his illegitimate half siblings in order to secure his claim. Joffery would also routinely torture and murder scores of people for his own amusement. These actions would cause a great deal of unrest in the city and lead to the commoners rioting against his rule. King Joffery would nearly be killed in one such riot. After the death of King Renly Baratheon, King Stannis Baratheon would sail for King's Landing. A battle would commence and be known as the [Battle of the Blackwater](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Blackwater). House Tyrell would flip to Joffery's side and aid in the defeat of Stannis. As a reward to House Tyrell, Joffery would pledge to marry [Margaery Tyrell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Margaery_Tyrell) setting aside his betrothal to [Sansa Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sansa_Stark). Joffery would eventually marry Margaery Tyrell at the [Purple Wedding](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Purple_Wedding) where he would meet his end at the poison of a dry pie. Joffery is remembered as a brutal King and was succeeded by his young brother Tommen.
