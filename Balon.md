## Bio
>Balon Greyjoy was born between 255 and 261 A.C. on the isle and castle of [Pyke](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Pyke), in the [Iron Islands](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Iron_Islands). The [Ironborn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ironborn) are people that pride themselves on raiding and Balon is a firm believer in the [old ways](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Old_Way) of his people. Balon was a fierce, fearless and bitter man. Balon attempted to make himself king twice in his life. The first time during the [Greyjoy Rebellion]9) and a second time during [The War of the Five Kings](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/War_of_the_Five_Kings).Balon would once more declare the Ironborn independent after the death of King Robert and assert his claim to [The North](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/North) in the absence of Robb Stark. The Ironborn would seize several castles and briefly occupy [Winterfell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell). Balon would unfortunately lose his only remaining son [Theon](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Theon_Greyjoy) as a captive to [House Bolton](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Bolton) and the Ironborn were slowly pushed out of The North. At the end of 299 A.C. Balon's treacherous younger brother [Euron “Crow’s Eye” Greyjoy](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Euron_Greyjoy) would return and Balon would die under mysterious circumstances. Balon would be remembered as a bitter king.For more info on Balon check out the [wiki](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Balon_Greyjoy).
