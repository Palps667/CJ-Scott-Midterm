## Bio
>Robb Stark is the eldest son of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady [Catelyn Tully](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Catelyn_Stark). Robb was born in Riverrun in the waning days of Robert's Rebellion. Robb would grow up to be a skilled warrior, courteous and honorable boy. Robb was close to all his siblings and to his father's ward [Theon Greyjoy](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Theon_Greyjoy). After the jailing of his father, Robb Stark called the Banners of the North to march south to free his father. At [The Twins](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Twins), Robb Stark would be forced to make a betrothal to a daughter to Lord [Walder Frey](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Walder_Frey) in order to cross the [Green Fork](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Green_Fork) of the [Trident](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Trident) river. After crossing the Green Fork, Robb would hurry south to relieve the siege of Riverrun. At the [Battle of Whispering Wood](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_in_the_Whispering_Wood), Robb would capture and defeat Jaime Lannister. Shortly after Robb would rout the Lannisters at the [Battle of the Camps](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Camps). After Ned Stark is executed, Robb proclaims himself King of the North and the Trident. Robb makes peace envoys to King's Landing but is rejected. Robb also sends envoys to King Renly Baratheon but these fail as well. Robb ventures west into the [Westerlands](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Westerlands) defeating several Lannister armies. Robb would also seize many castles however, he is wounded during the storming of one. It is around this time that word of the fall of [Winterfell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell) and the "death" of his younger brothers reach Robb. In a moment of despair Robb sleeps with Lady [Jeyne Westerling](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jeyne_Westerling). In order to preserve her honor he marries her. This severs ties with the Lord Walder Frey. Eventually ties with [House Karstark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Karstark) are broken as well leading to Robb resorting to making peace with [House Frey](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Frey). Walder Frey furious with Robb plots with Tywin Lannister and Lord [Roose Bolton](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Roose_Bolton) to kill Robb at the wedding of Robb's uncle Edmure to Walder's daughter Roslin. At the [Red Wedding](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Red_Wedding)Robb is killed alongside his mother. Roose Bolton assumes control of The North. Robb is remembered as a young, brave and brash King that was talented at war but terrible at politics.
