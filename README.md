# CJ Scott - Midterm
My name is Ian C.J. Scott. I'm a Junior majoring in Economics and History and minoring in Political Science, Constutional Democracy, and Ancient Meditteraen Studies. I'm taking this class as an elective for Economics. I love apple pie and butter pecan ice cream. I have an Xbox Series X and a PC. I built my pc exactly 3 years ago this time in 2020 and I built it primarly to play [Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord](https://www.taleworlds.com/en/Games/Bannerlord/) at the time. I now play a massive a whole heap of games. 

I'm a massive _Game of Thrones_ Fan and for my midterm project I wanted to do something fun. So I decided to do a summary of the War of the 5 Kings from the perspective of the Books.

  >The year is 297 A.C. It has been 14 years since [Robert's Rebellion.](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robert%27s_Rebellion) [Jon Arryn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Arryn) Hand of the King and Lord of the Vale has been assassinated. For 14 years bar the [Greyjoy Rebellion](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Greyjoy%27s_Rebellion), there has been peace. In the following year 298, A.C. [King Robert](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robert_I_Baratheon) traveled to The North to ask his friend [Lord Eddard Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eddard_Stark) to be the new Hand of the King. At [Winterfell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell), [Bran Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bran_Stark) son of Eddard has a mysterious accident and tensions begin to boil between Lannisters and Starks. Eddard (Ned) Stark acceps King Robert's offer and travels south to the capital, Kings Landing to assume his position as Hand of the King. Upon reaching the capital, Ned immediately begins investigating the death of Jon Arryn and arrives at two conclusions: Jon Arryn was likely murdered and that King Robert’s legitimate children, [Joffrey](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Joffrey_Baratheon), [Myrcella](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Myrcella_Baratheon) and [Tommen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tommen_Baratheon) are illegitimate children. King Robert’s children were born of [Queen Cersei's](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cersei_Lannister) twin brother Ser [Jaime Lannister](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaime_Lannister). Once Ned realizes this truth he warns Queen Cersei out of a sense of honor and for the security of her children. Cersei ignores Ned’s warning and has King Robert killed before anything could happen. Cersei swiftly crowns her son Joffery, as king. Ned protests this, as [Stannis Baratheon](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stannis_Baratheon), Robert’s younger brother, is the rightful monarch. Ned is imprisoned and eventually executed, sparking war between the Lannisters and the Starks. Stannis seeking his rightful throne, declares his claim for the throne. [Renly Baratheon](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Renly_Baratheon), younger brother of Robert and Stannis declares his claim and allies with the [Tyrells](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Tyrell). Sensing unease, [Balon Greyjoy](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Balon_Greyjoy) declares himself King again and revolts against the Iron throne. [Robb Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robb_Stark), son of Ned declares himself King of the North and Westeros finds itself at war once again.

## Bio 
>Joffery Baratheon was the son of King Robert Baratheon and  Queen Cersei Lannister. Joffery's biological father was Ser Jaime Lannister. Joffery grew up to be a spoiled sadistic child that thought nothing of others and only of himself. In 298 A.C., King Robert would die and Queen Cersei would crown Joffery as King. Joffery's first major act as King would be to order the death of Ned Stark. This action started the war between the Lannisters and the Starks and led to the capture of Joffery's true father, Jaime Lannister at the hands of the Starks. Joffery would not take the field personally as his faction was largely led by his Lannister family members. Chiefly, his grandfather the mighty [Tywin Lannister](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tywin_Lannister), Lord of the Westerlands. Joffery would reign with a marked sadistic streak ordering the death of his illegitimate half siblings in order to secure his claim. Joffery would also routinely torture and murder scores of people for his own amusement. These actions would cause a great deal of unrest in the city and lead to the commoners rioting against his rule. King Joffery would nearly be killed in one such riot. After the death of King Renly Baratheon, King Stannis Baratheon would sail for King's Landing. A battle would commence and be known as the [Battle of the Blackwater](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Blackwater). House Tyrell would flip to Joffery's side and aid in the defeat of Stannis. As a reward to House Tyrell, Joffery would pledge to marry [Margaery Tyrell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Margaery_Tyrell) setting aside his betrothal to [Sansa Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sansa_Stark). Joffery would eventually marry Margaery Tyrell at the [Purple Wedding](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Purple_Wedding) where he would meet his end at the poison of a dry pie. Joffery is remembered as a brutal King and was succeeded by his young brother Tommen.

## Bio
>Robb Stark is the eldest son of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady [Catelyn Tully](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Catelyn_Stark). Robb was born in Riverrun in the waning days of Robert's Rebellion. Robb would grow up to be a skilled warrior, courteous and honorable boy. Robb was close to all his siblings and to his father's ward [Theon Greyjoy](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Theon_Greyjoy). After the jailing of his father, Robb Stark called the Banners of the North to march south to free his father. At [The Twins](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Twins), Robb Stark would be forced to make a betrothal to a daughter to Lord [Walder Frey](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Walder_Frey) in order to cross the [Green Fork](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Green_Fork) of the [Trident](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Trident) river. After crossing the Green Fork, Robb would hurry south to relieve the siege of Riverrun. At the [Battle of Whispering Wood](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_in_the_Whispering_Wood), Robb would capture and defeat Jaime Lannister. Shortly after Robb would rout the Lannisters at the [Battle of the Camps](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Camps). After Ned Stark is executed, Robb proclaims himself King of the North and the Trident. Robb makes peace envoys to King's Landing but is rejected. Robb also sends envoys to King Renly Baratheon but these fail as well. Robb ventures west into the [Westerlands](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Westerlands) defeating several Lannister armies. Robb would also seize many castles however, he is wounded during the storming of one. It is around this time that word of the fall of [Winterfell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell) and the "death" of his younger brothers reach Robb. In a moment of despair Robb sleeps with Lady [Jeyne Westerling](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jeyne_Westerling). In order to preserve her honor he marries her. This severs ties with the Lord Walder Frey. Eventually ties with [House Karstark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Karstark) are broken as well leading to Robb resorting to making peace with [House Frey](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Frey). Walder Frey furious with Robb plots with Tywin Lannister and Lord [Roose Bolton](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Roose_Bolton) to kill Robb at the wedding of Robb's uncle Edmure to Walder's daughter Roslin. At the [Red Wedding](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Red_Wedding)Robb is killed alongside his mother. Roose Bolton assumes control of The North. Robb is remembered as a young, brave and brash King that was talented at war but terrible at politics.

Stannis would flee to Dragonstone and whilst there he would hear about the death of his brother and proclaim himself the One True King. Stannis would enjoy very little support and would have to compete with his brother [Renly](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Renly_Baratheon) for the support of the Storm Lords. Stannis would have to kill his brother Renly with magic via the red priestess [Melisandre](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Melisandre). Stannis would attack King’s Landing with the support of the Storm Lords but fail to seize the capital during the [Battle of the Blackwater](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Blackwater).
