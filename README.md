# CJ Scott - Midterm
My name is Ian C.J. Scott. I'm a Junior majoring in Economics and History and minoring in Political Science, Constitutional Democracy, and Ancient Mediterranean Studies. I'm taking this class as an elective for Economics. I love apple pie and butter pecan ice cream. I have an Xbox Series X and a PC. I built my pc exactly 3 years ago this time in 2020 and I built it primarily to play [Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord](https://www.taleworlds.com/en/Games/Bannerlord/) at the time. I now play a massive whole heap of games
 
I'm a massive _Game of Thrones_ Fan and for my midterm project I wanted to do something fun. So I decided to do a summary of the War of the 5 Kings from the perspective of the Books.

# The War of the Five Kings - Context

  >The year is 297 A.C. It has been 14 years since [Robert's Rebellion.](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robert%27s_Rebellion) [Jon Arryn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Arryn) Hand of the King and Lord of the Vale has been assassinated. For 14 years bar the [Greyjoy Rebellion](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Greyjoy%27s_Rebellion), there has been peace. In the following year 298, A.C. [King Robert](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robert_I_Baratheon) traveled to The North to ask his friend [Lord Eddard Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eddard_Stark) to be the new Hand of the King. At [Winterfell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell), [Bran Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bran_Stark) son of Eddard has a mysterious accident and tensions begin to boil between Lannisters and Starks. Eddard (Ned) Stark acceps King Robert's offer and travels south to the capital, Kings Landing to assume his position as Hand of the King. Upon reaching the capital, Ned immediately begins investigating the death of Jon Arryn and arrives at two conclusions: Jon Arryn was likely murdered and that King Robert’s legitimate children, [Joffrey](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Joffrey_Baratheon), [Myrcella](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Myrcella_Baratheon) and [Tommen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tommen_Baratheon) are illegitimate children. King Robert’s children were born of [Queen Cersei's](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cersei_Lannister) twin brother Ser [Jaime Lannister](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaime_Lannister). Once Ned realizes this truth he warns Queen Cersei out of a sense of honor and for the security of her children. Cersei ignores Ned’s warning and has King Robert killed before anything could happen. Cersei swiftly crowns her son Joffery, as king. Ned protests this, as [Stannis Baratheon](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stannis_Baratheon), Robert’s younger brother, is the rightful monarch. Ned is imprisoned and eventually executed, sparking war between the Lannisters and the Starks. Stannis seeking his rightful throne, declares his claim for the throne. [Renly Baratheon](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Renly_Baratheon), younger brother of Robert and Stannis declares his claim and allies with the [Tyrells](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Tyrell). Sensing unease, [Balon Greyjoy](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Balon_Greyjoy) declares himself King again and revolts against the Iron throne. [Robb Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robb_Stark), son of Ned declares himself King of the North and Westeros finds itself at war once again.

>Stannis Baratheon was born in [Storm's End](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Storm%27s_End) in 264 A.C. Stannis would be the younger brother of King Robert Baratheon and older brother to Renly Baratheon. As a child Stannis was a gloomy serious child. Stannis would seldom laugh. Stannis would lose his faith in the gods when he witnessed the death of his parents. Stannis would grow up to be a dutiful and serious man. Stannis would support his brother in Robert's Rebellion and endure a siege for almost a year at the hands of House Tyrell. Stannis and his men would be saved by the actions of [Davos Seaworth](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Davos_Seaworth) and onion smuggler turned knight by Stannis. Stannis would survive the siege and seize [Dragonstone](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonstone) in 284 A.C. After the war Stannis would be given Dragonstone instead of Storm's End, a slight he would not soon forgive. Stannis would fight with distinction during the Greyjoy Rebellion as [Master of Ships](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Master_of_ships). Stannis would grow suspicious of Cersei's children and would confine Jon Arryn about his suspicions. They would discover the truth shortly before Jon Arryn's death. Stannis would flee to Dragonstone and whilst there he would hear about the death of his brother and proclaim himself the One True King. Stannis would enjoy very little support and would have to compete with his brother [Renly](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Renly_Baratheon) for the support of the Storm Lords. Stannis would have to kill his brother Renly with magic via the red priestess [Melisandre](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Melisandre). Stannis would attack King’s Landing with the support of the Storm Lords but fail to seize the capital during the [Battle of the Blackwater](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Blackwater). Stannis would flee to Dragonstone, then travel north to assist the Night’s Watch against the [Wildings](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Free_folk). Stannis’s pursuit of the [Iron Throne](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Iron_Throne) is ongoing.
